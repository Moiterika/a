## Abstruct

The `a` package incluedes simple Go utilities of Moiterika LLC. 
This package is inspired by the language integrated query (LINQ) of .NET Framework. 
However this package does not contain a struct equivalent to the `Enumerable` class, so deferred execution using the iterator pattern is not possible.
