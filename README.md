# a

## Abstruct

The `a` package incluedes simple Go utilities of Moiterika LLC.
Most of the function names in this package are inspired by the language integrated query (LINQ) of .NET Framework.
However this package does not contain a struct equivalent to the `Enumerable` class, so deferred execution using the iterator pattern is not possible.
